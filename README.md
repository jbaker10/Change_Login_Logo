## El Capitan Note
With the release of OS X 10.11 El Capitan, this app will no longer work due to SIP.


DISCLAIMER:
Editing anything under /System/ on your Mac is very dangerous, and strongly advised AGAINST. Anything in this directory is reserved for the OS and is subject to change at any time without notice.

Proceed at your own risk.

Note: I strongly advise backing up any file/folders that you plan to change under the /System/ folder.
